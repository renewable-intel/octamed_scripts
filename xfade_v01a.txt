Usage: 
  
  1)  Move your pointer to an area of the sample you want to start the
      crossfade process and click the mouse.      
  
  2)  Launch this script.    
  
Notes:
  
  1)  If no starting point detected, this script will automatically
      default the crossfade amount to 3%.
        
  2)  Percentages range from 50 down to 1% (from the halfway
      point of the buffer towards the end). Selecting a point anywhere
      before the halfway point will register as 50% (The max allowed)
      
  3)  The percentage also reflects the amount that the buffer will
      be reduce by. (part of the crossfade process)  
  
  4)  To change the default percentage in this script, alter the 
      [pct] variable found on line 44 of the script.
  
To do: 
  
  1)  Use actual ranges (start & end) to create a xfade anywhere in the sample.
      This would allow the start of a sample to be untouched and offer sample sustain.
  
  2)  GUI interface for additional features.
  
  3)  Undo using the last sample slot.
